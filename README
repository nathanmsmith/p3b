Files:
- README: contains description of our included files.
- lab3b.py: Our solution to the program as described in the spec.
- Makefile: contains the makefile of the lab3b executable.

Notes:
- We chose python as our language to implement this project because we were both reasonably comfortable with it and knew that it had a lot of higher level features and data structures that would make processing a CSV file much easier than in a language such as C or C++.
